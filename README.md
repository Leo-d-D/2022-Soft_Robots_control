# 2022 COSMOS Program -- Soft Robots Control 

# Abstract 
The main problem facing soft robotics is the lack of suitable control systems. The flexibility of soft robots contin-
ues to confound attempts to model and control them, but
progress is being made. Many current mechanical designs
capitalize on the bleeding edge of material science. Methods for movement in zero gravity are also being tested
with hopeful results. Currently, novel control systems and
modified traditional systems are being used to control soft
robots. In addition, advances in computing power and
Artificial Intelligence techniques allow for greater semiautonomous control. Overall, the progress in modeling
and control systems has reached several milestones in accuracy and prediction while prototype robots are already
being tested in labs.

Soft robotics is garnering more and more attention due
to its great potential in a wide variety of fields and disciplines. In particular, they are better suited for use in space
because they are flexible, making them more resilient and
adaptable to a variety of obstacles. However, the lack of
air resistance and gravity in space means that any movement is amplified. As a result of this, precise control is very
important in space. However, traditional approaches cannot be applied to soft robots due to an unlimited range of
motion, making control a bottleneck in current applications.
